we found patients who were transferred early had a 55.8% reduction in risk of inhospital mortality than those whose transfer was later (relative risk, 0.442; 95% CI, 0.403â€“0.497). Additionally, the early transfer cohort had lower HLOS (20.7 fewer days [13.0 vs 33.7; p < 0.0001]), and lower cumulative charges ($66,201 less [$192,182 vs $258,383; p < 0.0001]).
